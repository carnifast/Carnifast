### Hi there 👋

- I'm a 4th Neuroscience student at Dalhousie University! 🧠
- I work under Dr. Kevin Duffy's supervision on my Honour's Project, which aims to reinstate visual cortex plasticity through gamma-frequency stimulation, in an attempt to treat amblyopia 😉
- I'm currently learning how to code in Python, R, and Matlab 👨🏻‍💻
- I'm looking to help develop bionic limbs and aim to make these economically available to anyone who needs them 🦾🦿
- Ask me about Italy and its food (I'm from there, maybe I'll make you something...)
- Fun fact: I was the Italian tennis champion in 2016 🎾
